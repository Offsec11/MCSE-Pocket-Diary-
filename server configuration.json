From within Server Manager, select “Add roles and features”.\n\n2.The Add Roles and Features Wizard window will appear, click the Next button.\n\n3.On the Select installation type screen, leave Role-based or feature-based\ninstallation selected and click Next.\n\n4. Click Next to continue.\n\n5.On the Select server roles screen, scroll down and select “Windows Server\nUpdate Services”.\n\n6. A new screen will appear advising you that new features will be added,\nsimply click the Add Features button. This will also add the IIS role, as this is\nused to serve content out.\n\n9. After this click Next to proceed.\n\n10. Click next\n\n11. On the Content location selection, we have the option of selecting where\nthe WSUS updates will be stored. Give a valid location for storing updation\n\n12. On the Web Server Role (IIS) screen, you are advised that IIS 10.0 will be\nused for WSUS, simply click next to continue.\n\n13.Finally on the Confirm installation selections, review your choices and click\nthe Install button to begin the installation process.\n\nConfiguring WSUS :\n\n1. To start this process, simply open the WSUS console from within the Tools\nmenu in Server Manager.\n\n2. From the Complete WSUS Installation window, we will select that we wish\nto store our updates locally in the folder specified.\n\n3. After you click Run, the WSUS Configuration Wizard will open which we\nwill now run through.\n\n4. On the Windows Server Update Services Configuration Wizard before you\nbegin page, read the information and click Next. Basically you should\nconfirm that other Windows machines can connect to the WSUS server,\nand that the WSUS server can connect to the Internet to download updates.\n\n5. Choose whether or not you want to join the Microsoft Update\nImprovement Program, as I am running a test instance I have select to not\njoin and provide any false test data.\n\n6. Next you will choose your upstream server. If this is your first WSUS server,\nyou will likely want to leave the default setting to synchronize from\nMicrosoft update over the Internet. This will download update files from\nMicrosoft to your WSUS server. Alternatively if you already have another\nWSUS server that stores the update files, you can specify it here to\nsynchronize with it as a downstream server.\n\n7. Next specify if your WSUS server needs to connect through a proxy server\nin order to connect to the Internet. In my test environment the WSUS\nserver connects directly out to the Internet so I’ll just select next, however\nif you’re using a proxy server specify its details here.\n\n8. Now we are asked to connect to an upstream server, click the start\nconnecting button to save the information entered so far. You’ll need to\nwait a while WSUS attempts to connect to an upstream server, either from\nthe Internet or within your own network based on your selection in the last\nstep. This took quite a long time (over 30 minutes) to complete\n\n9. Choose the languages that you want to download updates for. Note that\nyou should only select the languages that you actually support, if you select\nadditional languages additional update files will be downloaded for each\nupdate to include your language selection which can quickly increase your\ndisk space requirements.\n\n10. On the Choose products screen simply select the Microsoft products in your\nnetwork that you plan on updating with WSUS. Updates for the selected\nproducts will be stored on our WSUS server, so the more you pick the more\ndisk space you will require.\n\n11. We can now choose the types of updates to download, for example we can\nspecify that we only want to download critical and security updates.\n\n12. Finally we can set the synchronization schedule which will specify when\nWSUS will check for new updates to download.
